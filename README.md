# Recommendations with IBM

A study project during my Udacity Data Science Course that includes different kinds of recommendations:
* Rank-based recommendations
* User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
* Content Based Recommendations
* Matrix Factorization (Single Value Decomposition)


### Background

On the IBM Watson studio, various articles about Data Science can be obtained. The students receive CSV files with
user-item interactions (which user read which article) and with information about the articles.


### Files

* Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb: Main file with the tasks and solutions
* project_tests.py: Python file with tests that are executed in the notebook to check the results
* Four pickle files: Files that are used by the project_tests.py and the notebook.


### Tasks and recommendations


#### Rank-Based Recommendations

This recommendation gives back the top rated articles. "Top rated" means in this context most user-item interactions.
This kind of recommendation is especially useful if we don't have any other information about the user's preferences.


#### User-User Based Collaborative Filtering

This recommendation is based on finding similar users: Any user that has interacted with the same articles as the user,
we are making recommendations for, can help us with finding new articles that could be of interest.

One drawback of recommendation system is that a new user, that didn't interact with any article before, cannot receive
recommendations based on this system.


#### Content Based Recommendations

##### Approach

1. This recommender tokenizes the text in a specific df_content column; I chose `doc_full_name`.
(Function: get_tokens_content)
2. For each token, an additional column is generated; then these features are used to compute the dot_product matrix of
all items. (Function: features_and_dot)
3. For a given article_id, the recommender looks for other article_ids with a high dot product and returns the
article_ids and article_names. (Function: make_content_recs)

##### Improvements

* I have used the column `doc_full_name` for tokenization. However, I have not tried the other columns which may provide
more specific information about the articles.
* For tokenization, I removed punctuation from the text, however there are still some single words or letters
('g' or 'ost') which still exist and corrupt the dot product (e.g. a lot of article names have a 'g'). This could be
improved with more Regex.
* As "similar_idxs", I chose all articles, that have a higher dot product than the median of the specific article row.
However, they are not sorted, which means that when chosing only the first 10 articles, other articles with a higher dot
product may not be shown.


#### Matrix FactorizationÂ¶

This technique uses Single Value Decomposition (SVD) and needs a certain number of latent features that describe certain
users or articles (e.g. this user likes Data Science or this article is about Machine Learning). The use of SVD provides
three different datasets that can be used to predict values and hence interactions.

Unfortunately, SVD does not work if there are any NaNs in the datasets, which is where FunkSVD comes into play.


### How to interact

Every contribution is welcome. I think there are many possibilities to improve the performance of the content based
recommendation system (see above).
